### ReactJS - YouTube Clone

**Final Preview:**
Not Yet (Soon I hope)

**Description:** From looking around on YouTube/Reddit it appears that making clones of websites are becomes the trend for web developers who want to test themselves so whilst using the YouTube V3 API on RapidAPI I decided to create a YouTube clone.

**Sections Completed**:
	1) Header - Y
	2) Sidebar - Y (Not Functionality)
	3) Video Category Selector - Y
	4) Feed - Y
	5) Playing Videos - N
	6) Searchbar - N
	7) Channel Profiles - N
	8) Hiding API Key - N (On the Free version but will still be good to learn)
	9) Deploying to a server - N 
	
**Problems Face (Date - 28/09/2022):**
	1) Certain texts such as the nation and the links are underlined even using the 'textDecloration: none' style. Fixed: X
	2) When using the API to get the title of videos some include symbols no idea why. Fixed: X
	3) Using the video category section on the feed the API only selects video with the name 
	   of the category on the title compared to YouTube's tag system which the API doesn't include. May switch to the official YouTube API. Fixed: X
	4) Image sizing of video thumbnails. Should be easy but nothing is 'easy' with programming sometimes. Fixed X
